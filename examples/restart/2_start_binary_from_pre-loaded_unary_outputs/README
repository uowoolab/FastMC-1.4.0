Example: Starting a Binary Simulation from a Unary Configuration

This example demonstrates how to use a unary simulation as the starting point for a binary simulation. We have provided output files from a completed simulation of CO2 absorbed in CALF-20, using a 4 x 3 x 3 supercell.

Instructions:

1. Copy the Configuration:
   From the pre-loaded_configuration directory, copy the REVCON file into the binary_from_pre-loaded_configuration directory and rename it to CONFIG.

2. Update the FIELD File:
   Follow the restart steps to ensure the correct number of guest molecules in the CONFIG file matches the NUMMOL value in the FIELD file.

3. Set Up the CONTROL File:
   Unlike a restart, you do not need to include restart in the CONTROL file. Instead, configure the parameters as you would for a new binary simulation.

Note: The REVIVE file is not required, as you are not restarting a simulation but rather starting a new one from an existing CONFIG file.
